These clauses have been enhanced based on the guidance of the European Data Protection Board and will be updated when the new draft model clauses are approved.</p>
            <p>Depending on the circumstance, LOGIKCO also collects and transfers to the U.S. personal data with consent; to perform a contract with you; or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of LOGIKCO in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms.
